# Comparator Live

Comparator Live gives an online interface to the
[Lean `comparator` tool](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator/) tool,
Lean's "gold standard" for validating proofs from untrusted sources.

Comparator Live is intended as a limited-purpose tool, it's goal is to clearly
signify the conditions under which users can rely on a Lean proof from an
unreliable, potentially malicious, or AI source. To this end, Comparator Live
differs in several ways from the the command-line `comparator` utility that it
invokes:

- While `comparator` allows configuration of permitted axioms, Comparator Live
  always uses the standard set of three permitted axioms: `propext`,
  `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice`.
- While `comparator` allows set of challenge theorems to be configured,
  Comparator Live automatically infers the challenge theorems as all the
  theorems declared in the challenge.
- Comparator Live introduces a notion of "trusted challenges."

## Trusted Challenges

A trusted challenge for Comparator Live is simply one that can be relied on to
reliably present the theorem statement. Knowing when this is the case can be
difficult for novice users, so Comparator Live treats a built-in set of proofs
as reliable and trusted; these challenges are identified by their hash(\*).

Users can additionally mark specific challenges as locally trusted; these will
not be loudly flagged as unreliable in the UI.

(\*) We normalize the trailing whitespace, so the hash of a challenge is
`sha256(challenge.trimRight() + "\n")`

Trusted challenges are derived from
[`lean-eval` benchmark](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval/) and from
files in `Projects/MathlibDemo/TrustedChallenges`. These can be updated by
running `npm run update-trusted` from the repository root.

## How Comparator Live runs `comparator`

Comparator Live does its own compilation of source files to olean files; this
is necessary (at least for the challenge) because we need to inspect the
challenge's olean file in order to find out what theorems it contains.

Bubblewrap is used for sandboxing these tasks in production, **development
mode does no sandboxing and should not be used to evaluate unknown challenges
or untrusted solutions**.

Each task runs in the context of a Lean project (e.g. `MathlibDemo`) that
lives in a directory `$PROJECT_DIR`, and each task is given its own temporary
working directory `$WORK_DIR`. In parallel:

- The challenge file is placed as `Challenge.lean` in an initially empty
  `$WORK_DIR/Challenge`, and that directory is used as an overlay atop
  `$PROJECT_DIR` for compiling the challenge. Compilation is only able to
  write to `$WORK_DIR/Challenge/.lake/build`.
- The candidate solution is placed as `Solution.lean` in an initially empty
  `$WORK_DIR/Solution`, and that directory is used as an overlay directory
  atop `$PROJECT_DIR` for compiling the solution. Compilation is only able to
  write to `$WORK_DIR/Solution/.lake/build`.

After this, the `challenge-thms` utility is run with an overlay setup of
`$WORK_DIR/Challenge` -> `$PROJECT_DIR` -> (temp dir to capture writes).
Putting the `$PROJECT_DIR` on top helps ensure the integrity of the
`challenge-thms` executable, which lives in `$PROJECT_DIR`.

Finally, the `comparator` utility is run with an overlay setup of
`$PROJECT_DIR` -> `$WORK_DIR/Solution` -> `$WORK_DIR/Challenge` -> (temp dir
to capture writes). Placing the challenge on top in the overlay ensures that
the the solution cannot corrupt the challenge: any files written by the
challenge compilation process will be visible regardless of what files the
solution wrote.

It's not necessary for `comparator` to have access to the compiled `.olean`
files. We needed to compile the challenge ourselves anyway in order to get the
list of relevant theorems, and comparator is designed to avoid recompiling the
challenge and solution if they've already been compiled to olean by other
means.

## Development mode setup

Comparator Live can be run in development mode; the only dependencies are
`lean` and `npm`.

1. In the repository's `./Projects/MathlibDemo` directory, run
   ```
   lake build
   lake build comparator
   lake build lean4export
   ```
2. Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` in the repository's root directory
3. Go to `http://localhost/5173`

## Production mode setup

In development mode, `comparator` and `lean4export` are dependencies of the
project.

In production mode, the correct version of comparator or lean4export needs to
be _checked out_ and built in a subdirectory of each supported project, like
this:

```
 - Projects/
   - MathlibDemo/ (Lean v4.31.0-rc1)
     - comparator/ (Lean v4.31.0-rc1 or higher)
     - lean4export/ (Lean v4.31.0-rc1)
   - mathlib-stable/ (Lean v4.30.0)
     - comparator/ (Lean v4.30.0 or higher)
     - lean4export/ (Lean v4.30.0)
```

Production mode expects the following environment variables set:

- `PORT` (optional, defaults to 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` set to `production`
- `COMPARATOR_PROJECT_BASE_PATH` set to the `Projects` directory configured as
  above
- `LANDRUN_DIR` set to the directory where a comparator-compatible `LANDRUN`
  (compiled from the main branch, as of mid-2026 the latest release is
  insufficient)
